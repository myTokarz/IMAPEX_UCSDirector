# IMAPEX - UCS Director

Cisco UCS Director abstracts hardware and software into programmable tasks that are assembled together to provision infrastructure across computing, networking, and storage resources that reside on multiple hyper-visors. 

## UCS Director Workflows

 - Importing
 - version management
 - screen shots

## UCS Director Custom Tasks
A task is a single action or operation with inputs and outputs.  Use these to create repeatable atomic units of work.  Anytime you find yourself writing cloudpia script consider if it would be better placed in a custom task.
 
 Example Custom Task and report integration

```
importPackage(java.lang);
importPackage(java.util);
importPackage(com.cloupia.lib.util.managedreports);
 
function getReport(reportContext, reportName)
{
     var report = null;
      try  {
             report = ctxt.getAPI().getConfigTableReport(reportContext, reportName);
      } catch(e) {
      }
 
      if (report == null)
      {
             return ctxt.getAPI().getTabularReport(reportName, reportContext);
      } else
     {
           var source = report.getSourceReport();
           return ctxt.getAPI().getTabularReport(source, reportContext);
     }
}
 
function getReportView(reportContext, reportName)
{
      var report = getReport(reportContext, reportName);
 
     if (report == null)
     {
           logger.addError("No such report exists for the specified context "+reportName);
 
           return null;
     }
 
     return new TableView(report);
}
 
// following are only sample values and need to be modified based on actual UCSM account name
var ucsmAccountName = "ucs-account-1";

// repot name is obtained from Repot Meta data 
var reportName = "TABULAR_REPORT_VMS_PAGINATED_CONFIG_REPORT";
 
var repContext = util.createContext("global", null, null);

var report = getReportView(repContext, reportName);
 
// Get only the rows for which our user is part of
report = report.filterRowsByColumn("Assigned To User", input.UserID, false);

var matchingIds = [];
var count = 0;
 
logger.addInfo("report has this many rows: "+report.rowCount());

for (var i=0; i<report.rowCount(); i++)
{
     logger.addInfo("User "+report.getColumnValue(i,"Assigned To User")+" is assigned to VM "+report.getColumnValue(i,"VM Name"));
	count++;
}

output.VMsAssigned =  count
```
## Developer Integration
####Administration --> Downloads
##### **Rest API SDK**<BR>
The Cisco UCS Director REST API SDK Bundle is part of the Cisco UCS Director REST API. In addition to documentation, such as Cookbook, the SDK Bundle provides examples that you can use with the REST API. These examples include test cases and sample code that demonstrates the use of the SDK classes. 
##### **PowerShell Console**<BR>
Cisco UCS Director PowerShell Console provides cmdlet wrappers for the JSON-based APIs. Each cmdlet performs a single operation. The cmdlets are executed in a Microsoft Windows server. Depending on the data returned by the JSON-based APIs, the cmdlets automatically interpret the data and convert it into Windows PowerShell objects. You can chain multiple cmdlets together. After installed to view a list of available cmdlets, execute 'Get-Command'.
##### **Open Automation SDK**<BR>
The Cisco UCS Director platform architecture consists of two components: the Cisco UCS Director Platform Runtime and the set of modules that get executed on the platform. The platform provides the required APIs and management functionality so that the modules can perform their intended functions. The modules provide the necessary intelligence and features. The platform provides a loosely-coupled plug-in architecture where modules can be developed, deployed and executed against the platform.  Using tools such as Cisco UCS Director Open Automation and the SDK, you can develop and deploy a module that can be executed on the Cisco UCS Director platform runtime.
